        The PATH Train
    </h2>

    <p>
        <h2 id="about">About the PATH:</h2>
        The PATH train is a fast and convenient way to get from Hoboken to New York City. Run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, these trains run underneath the Hudson River. The Hoboken station can be found at the edge of the city, at the intersection of 1st and River Streets. The PATH terminal is beneath the NJ Transit portion of the station, where trains and busses run to various points in New Jersey and New York. From the sidewalk, signs and markings will direct you to the stairs down into the PATH section of the station. The PATH website can be found <a href="https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/index.html">here.</a>

        <h2 id="ticket">Purchasing a Ticket:</h2>
        In the station, there are many different kiosks that are available. The one shown below is the vending machine for One-Way tickets. TICKETS cost $2.75 each way. If you have a New York City MetroCard, you can use it to ride the PATH, provided that there is money loaded on the card. The larger kiosks, shown below, take cash or card. There are Two-Trip MetroCard kiosks, which only take cash, cost $5.50, and can be used on the NYC Subway as well as the PATH. Follow the instructions on the kiosk (either posted on a sign or on the screen as prompted). If you intend on visiting frequently, purchasing a MetroCard is likely for the best.
