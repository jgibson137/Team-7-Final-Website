                 This is a beautiful park with breathtaking views of NYC. It's a large outdoor area with lots of green space, playgrounds, movie nights under the stars, water sports activities, and the best food trucks you can imagine.
             </li>
            <li>Pier 13 is one of the best places to go to in the warmer months of the year, so it's definitely a great spot to come to when arriving to campus

            <li>
                The Hudson River Waterfront is a nice pathway on the western shore of the Hudson River to go on a nice walk or jog with friends. Even if you need a break to be alone once in a while, this is the perfect spot to go to, to get a break from all the stress and unwind.
